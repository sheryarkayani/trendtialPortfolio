      question: "What do all these people and their businesses have in common?",
      answer:
        "Kylie Jenner - Kylie Cosmetics - Youngest Person to Become a Billionaire\nRihanna - Fenty Beauty - 2.8 Billion Dollar Valuation\nRyan Reynolds - Mint Mobile - Sold for 1 Billion\nLogan Paul - Prime - 3.1 Billion Dollar Valuation\nThe Rock - Teremana Tequila - 3.5 Billion Dollar Valuation\n\nAll these people built up their personal brands by acting, singing, TV, or social media. When they started businesses because they had such BIG personal brands their companies exploded. Their personal brand essentially was their marketing. Social media is the best way for your average person to do this without being an actor, singer, or athlete. A regular business owner can build themselves and their business on social media like never before. There is a huge opportunity here, if you don't take it your competitors will and will take all your customers with them.",
